Here's my first hosted website. It's a website in which I talk about my favorite videogame soundtracks. You can listen to a 15 second extract of the song and click on the the red button in the bottom right corner of the section. At the end, there is a form in which you were supposed to be able to add a new section where you could put a 15 second extract of a song; adescription and an image but it doesn't work unfortunately :( I'll be working on thtat issue in the future so be patient for the time being.
